## You are cordially invited to write an article for the 2018 Perl Advent Calendar.

The CFP is open on midnight on Sunday September 30th EST.

## What's all this about then?

As an advent calendar author you will write one entry on a module of your
choosing that will be revealed to the world on
[The Perl Advent Calendar](http://www.perladvent.org/)
on a given day of Advent (between the 1st and 24th of December 2018 inclusive).

The Perl Advent Calendar welcomes diverse author submissions from all types of
Perl programmer.  It is our firm belief that every Perl programmer, no matter
how advanced or how novice, has a favorite Perl module they want to tell the
world about.  The module that is the subject of the article need not be written
by the article author, and more often than not this is not the case.

The Perl Advent Calendar also believes that the pool of authors should not be
limited to people who have English as their first language.  Authors who speak
English as a second language are encouraged to submit.  Each article submission
undergoes an editorial process which assists those authors who may need help
with their writing.

In order to participate in the Perl Advent Calendar please use
[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQUctVOLGhwCZtBKlnPaGxcszmQiBsq5Wck-t5ceGpB6C1IQ/viewform)
to submit your chosen module and a brief description of your article (which need
be no more than two or three sentences) by no later than **11:59 PM EST Sunday
September 30th 2018**.

We look forward to hearing from you!

### Guidelines on the Articles ###

- The best way to see what we're after in an article is to take a look at
  [the previous year's articles](http://www.perladvent.org/2017/).

- Our articles should try and be light and trivial and along the Christmas theme.  Our variable names can be `$rudolph`, or `$frosty`, or `$mrhankey`.  Our articles
are often stories of problems fictional Christmas characters have.  In all, we
try to be entertaining in our articles.

- We like our articles to contain text and code interspersed, and if necessary a final script at the end with lots of comments.

- Pictures, graphs, and other graphics are good and highly encouraged.  Last year we included animated gifs of terminal output, renders of spinning OpenGL snowflakes, and a full interactive JavaScript map of the world showing off GeoIP location from Perl.

- Formatting is in POD with a custom header.  See [the source for previous year's articles](https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/tree/master/2017/articles) for examples.  You can use [`=for html`](https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/blame/master/2015/articles/2015-12-02.pod#L75) or even [`=for web_only` and `=for rss_only`](https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/blame/master/2015/articles/2015-12-01.pod#L7) if needed to add custom HTML to your POD.
