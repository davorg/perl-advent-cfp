## You are cordially invited to write an article for the 2023 Perl Advent Calendar.

The CFP is open until midnight on Friday September 30th EST.

## What's all this about then?

As an advent calendar author you will write one entry on a module of your
choosing that will be revealed to the world on
[The Perl Advent Calendar](https://www.perladvent.org/)
on a given day of Advent (between the 1st and 24th of December 2023 inclusive).

The Perl Advent Calendar welcomes diverse author submissions from all types of
Perl programmers.  It is our firm belief that every Perl programmer, no matter
how advanced or how novice, has a favorite Perl module they want to tell the
world about.  The module that is the subject of the article need not be written
by the article author, and more often than not this is not the case.

The Perl Advent Calendar seeks to be an inclusive project.
We encourage and sincerely welcome articles from authors of color,
women, queer article authors, transgender authors and from other communities
not well represented in the tech world.  We do not discriminate on the basis
of religion (yes, that means you can write a Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Solstice,
Wintereenmas, or Agnostica article if you want.)  Our
[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)
governs our interactions in the project.

The Perl Advent Calendar believes that the pool of authors should not be
limited to people who have English as their first language.  Authors who speak
English as a second language are encouraged to submit.  Each article submission
undergoes an editorial process which assists those authors who may need help
with their writing.

In order to participate in the Perl Advent Calendar please [create an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/issues/new?assignees=&labels=article&template=i-want-to-write-an-article.md&title=)
to submit your chosen module and a brief description of your article (which need
be no more than two or three sentences) by no later than **11:59 PM EST Friday
September 30th 2023**.  If you don't have an idea for an article but would
be open to some suggestions or coming up with an article idea later on, just say
so in the submission!

We look forward to hearing from you!

### Timelines ###

* 11:59 PM EST Friday September 30th 2023: Deadline for article proposal
  submission.

  be notified if their article has been accepted.

* 11:59 PM EST Tuesday **November 1st 2023**: First draft of article submission
  committed by author into Perl Advent Calendar Github repository.  This need
  not be 100% completed at this point, but at this stage the Perl Advent
  Calendar editorial team will start the editing process (correcting typos,
  editing for house style, making sure the article renders correctly, suggesting
  language and graphics improvements, etc).

  to the articles.

* 12:00 AM EST Thursday **December 1st 2023**: Advent begins.  Go live date.

### Guidelines on the Articles ###

- The best way to see what we're after in an article is to take a look at
  [a previous year's articles](https://www.perladvent.org/2022/).

- Our articles should try and be light and trivial and along the Christmas theme.
Our variable names can be `$rudolph`, or `$frosty`, or `$mrhankey`.  Our articles
are often stories of problems fictional Christmas characters have.  In all, we
try to be entertaining in our articles.

- We like our articles to contain text and code interspersed, and if necessary a final script at the end with lots of comments.

- Pictures, graphs, and other graphics are good and highly encouraged.  In the last few years we included animated gifs of terminal output, renders of spinning OpenGL snowflakes, SVG Christmas trees, Christmas cats and dogs from Imgur, Spotify playlists, a full interactive JavaScript map of the world showing off GeoIP location from Perl, and even Perl executing in the browser.  Go nuts!

- Formatting is in POD with a custom header.  See [the source for previous years' articles](https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/tree/main/2022/articles) for examples.  You can use [`=for html`](https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/blame/main/2015/articles/2015-12-02.pod#L75) or even [`=for web_only` and `=for rss_only`](https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/blame/main/2015/articles/2015-12-01.pod#L7) if needed to add custom HTML to your POD.
